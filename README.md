# EveProject

This is my personal work. I am attempting to build my own WebApp from the ground up. The app will allow me to view and manipulate various
types of data from the Eve Online ESI API.

I would love some feedback or advice on building a database, especially a table for TypeIDs and ItemNames.
If you look at both 'singlepagepull.py' and 'single_item_pull.py' you can see how I am currently going about this.

This method takes approximately 10 hours to build just the Table holding TypeIDs and ItemNames. 

If anyone has a better method for building out this particular database, please let me know.

Thanks.
